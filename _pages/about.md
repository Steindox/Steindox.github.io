Welcome to my academic website! I am an undergraduate student at Southern University of Science and Technology (SUSTech), advised by Prof. Hao Yu. My research focuses on efficient AI, model compression, hardware acceleration, and foundation model optimization.

I am passionate about working at the intersection of algorithms and hardware, developing practical solutions for real-world AI applications. Currently, I am seeking PhD opportunities for Fall 2026 to further explore these research directions.

## Research Interests
- **Model Compression**: Developing efficient pruning and quantization techniques for large language models
- **Hardware Acceleration**: Optimizing AI models for deployment on various hardware platforms
- **Foundation Model Optimization**: Improving the efficiency and performance of foundation models
- **Algorithm-Hardware Co-design**: Exploring the intersection of algorithmic improvements and hardware optimization

## Current Work
My current research focuses on developing novel pruning frameworks for large language models, with a particular interest in one-shot pruning techniques that can efficiently reduce model size while maintaining performance.
